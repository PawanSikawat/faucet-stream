//! Source sharding for clustered (Mode B) execution.
//!
//! A *shardable* source can split its work into independent [`ShardSpec`]s that
//! different cluster workers process concurrently — so one logical pipeline over
//! a single large source (a big S3 prefix, a billion-row table) scales
//! horizontally instead of being capped at one worker's throughput.
//!
//! The capability is exposed as **defaulted methods on the
//! [`Source`](crate::Source) trait**
//! ([`enumerate_shards`](crate::Source::enumerate_shards),
//! [`apply_shard`](crate::Source::apply_shard),
//! [`is_shardable`](crate::Source::is_shardable)) rather than a separate trait,
//! so it composes with the existing `Box<dyn Source>` object model with no
//! downcast and stays fully backward compatible: a source that does not override
//! them reports `is_shardable() == false` and enumerates to a single
//! whole-dataset shard, i.e. it behaves exactly as today.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. A coordinator calls [`enumerate_shards`](crate::Source::enumerate_shards)
//!    once per run (idempotently) to discover the shard set.
//! 2. Each shard is persisted and claimed by exactly one worker.
//! 3. The claiming worker calls [`apply_shard`](crate::Source::apply_shard) to
//!    narrow its source instance to that one shard before streaming.
//! 4. Each shard carries its own state-key suffix so resume is per-shard: a
//!    reassigned shard resumes where its dead owner left off.
