//! Every sink decorator must forward `local_outputs()` (#587).
//!
//! The retention GC can only delete files it was told about, and it learns about
//! them from `Sink::local_outputs()` on the outermost sink in the decorator
//! chain. A decorator that falls back to the trait's empty default therefore does
//! not fail, log, or misbehave in any visible way — it silently hides every file
//! its inner sink created, and those files are never reclaimed. The symptom is a
//! disk filling up weeks later, in a build with one particular feature enabled.
//!
//! That is precisely the bug review caught in `InstrumentedSink`, which forwarded
//! neither `local_outputs()` nor `dataset_uri()` while every sibling decorator
//! did. It was invisible to a grep for existing forwards, and no test covered it
//! because the end-to-end suite only ever exercises the default sink chain —
//! `MetadataSink`, `CleanupTracker`, and `InstrumentedSink` are each activated by
//! a config or feature that the happy path does not use.
//!
//! So this test enumerates the decorators explicitly and asserts the pair of
//! identity/provenance methods survives each one. Adding a decorator to core
//! means adding it here; the cost of forgetting is unreclaimed data.
//!
//! `InstrumentedSink` is covered by a unit test in `observability::decorator`
//! instead, since that module is private — widening the API for a test would be
//! the wrong trade.
