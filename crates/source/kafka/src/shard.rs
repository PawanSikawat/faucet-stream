//! Group-member sharding for clustered (Mode B) execution — issue #261.
//!
//! Kafka already solves work distribution inside the broker: consumers that
//! share a `group.id` have the topic's partitions assigned across them by the
//! consumer-group protocol, and a member failure triggers a rebalance onto the
//! survivors. So the Kafka source does **not** enumerate disjoint data slices
//! the way the PK-range / hash-of-key sharders do — each "shard" is simply a
//! *membership slot*: "run one more consumer in the shared group". N claimed
//! member shards ⇒ N cooperating group members ⇒ the broker splits partitions
//! among them with no duplication and rebalances on membership change.
//!
//! Offset continuity across members is delegated to the group's **committed
//! offsets**: in member mode the source commits each page's offsets to the
//! broker once that page is durable (see
//! [`KafkaSource::stream_pages`](crate::stream::KafkaSource)), so a partition
//! that migrates to another member (rebalance, worker death, shard reclaim)
//! resumes from the last durably-written position. The state-store bookmark
//! remains the per-member safety net for the crash window between a durable
//! write and its commit — the rebalance callback seeks to the bookmark only
//! when it is *ahead* of the committed offset (never behind, which would
//! re-read work another member already completed).
//!
//! Everything in this module is pure (no I/O) so it is unit-testable without
//! a broker.
