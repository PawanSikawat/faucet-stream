//! # faucet-sink-kinesis
//!
//! AWS Kinesis Data Streams sink connector for
//! [faucet-stream](https://github.com/faucet-hq/faucet-stream): batched
//! `PutRecords` writes with configurable partition-key derivation, bounded
//! concurrent in-flight requests, per-entry partial-failure retry, and
//! DLQ-routable per-record outcomes.
//!
//! Delivery is **at-least-once**: an ambiguous whole-request failure that is
//! retried can double-write records that actually landed. Key downstream
//! consumers on an idempotency field when replays must converge.
