//! # faucet-sink-sqs
//!
//! AWS SQS sink connector for
//! [faucet-stream](https://github.com/PawanSikawat/faucet-stream): batched
//! `SendMessageBatch` writes (≤10 entries / ≤256 KiB per request), bounded
//! concurrent in-flight requests, per-entry partial-failure retry, optional
//! FIFO `message_group_id` / `message_deduplication_id`, and DLQ-routable
//! per-record outcomes.
//!
//! Delivery is **at-least-once**: an ambiguous whole-request failure that is
//! retried can double-write messages that actually landed. On a FIFO queue set
//! `message_deduplication_id_field` (or enable content-based dedup on the
//! queue) so replays within the 5-minute dedup window converge.
