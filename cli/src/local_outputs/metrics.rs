//! `faucet_local_outputs_*` metrics for the local-output retention GC (#587).
//!
//! Deliberately a separate family from `faucet_cleanup_*`: that one counts
//! *destination rows* deleted by scoped cleanup (#478). Folding file deletions
//! into it would make a single counter mean two unrelated things and quietly
//! break anyone alerting on either.
//!
//! A GC that deletes data must never be silent, so the counters carry the
//! outcome breakdown as labels — a rising `skipped{reason="delete_failed"}`
//! means the footprint is *not* being bounded and is worth alerting on.
