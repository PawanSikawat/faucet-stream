//! The generic half of the preview engine (#586).
//!
//! One operation, no knowledge of *why* it was asked for:
//!
//! ```text
//! PreviewRequest { kind, config, rows }  →  PreviewPage { rows, columns, capped_by }
//! ```
//!
//! It builds the connector through the same registry `faucet run` uses, drives
//! [`Source::stream_pages`], and stops as soon as one of its bounds is reached.
//! Nothing here knows about local files, the local-output ledger, or the dev
//! flag — that is the caller's policy (see [`super`]).
//!
//! ## Why the row cap is enforced by *stopping*, not by truncating
//!
//! `rows + 1` records are read and then the stream is dropped. Every file source
//! in the workspace streams lazily (`async_stream::try_stream!` over a
//! `BufReader`, or an Arrow `ParquetRecordBatchStream`), so dropping the stream
//! stops the read: a 500-row preview of a 4 GiB file touches the first few
//! kilobytes. Reading the *whole* result set and slicing it would be the same
//! API with none of the point — and it is what makes "show me more rows" cheap
//! enough that this engine needs no offset or cursor (see [`super`]).
//!
//! The extra record is what makes truncation an observation instead of a guess:
//! "there is at least one more row" is knowable for free, and "exactly `rows`
//! rows" is otherwise indistinguishable from "the file happens to have `rows`
//! rows".
//!
//! ## Three bounds, because "unlimited" must still terminate
//!
//! A [`RowCap::Unlimited`] read — the whole-dataset preview — has no row bound,
//! so the other two do the work:
//!
//! | bound | limit | on hit |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | rows | [`RowCap`] | [`Capped::Rows`] |
//! | response size | [`Bounds::max_bytes`] | [`Capped::Bytes`] |
//! | wall clock | [`Bounds::deadline`] | [`Capped::Time`] |
//!
//! All three produce a **partial answer that says it is partial**, never an
//! error: asking for a whole dataset that does not fit gets you as much of it as
//! fits, plus the reason it stopped. Only [`Bounds::hard_timeout`] — a single
//! page that never returns at all — fails the request outright, because there is
//! nothing partial to hand back.
//!
//! ### The bounds only work if every page is bounded
//!
//! Both are checked *as pages arrive*, so they can only interrupt a read that
//! arrives in pieces. Ask a source for one unbounded page and it will hand back
//! the whole file in a single `Vec` before either bound is ever consulted —
//! which is precisely what this engine used to do on the unlimited path
//! (`batch_size: 0`, every source's "drain into one page" sentinel), turning a
//! 40 GiB `out.jsonl` into an OOM while the docs promised a truncated answer.
//!
//! So the engine **never requests an unbounded page**: an unlimited read is
//! unlimited in *rows*, paged at [`PREVIEW_UNLIMITED_PAGE_ROWS`]. The residual,
//! stated plainly because it is not something this layer can fix: a source that
//! ignores the page-size hint and materializes its whole result set anyway (the
//! default [`Source::stream_pages`] does exactly that, via `fetch_with_context`)
//! is bounded by that source, not by us. It matters for #591's remote sources,
//! not for the three file readers here, all of which page lazily.
