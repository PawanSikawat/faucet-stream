# faucet-stream vs. Fivetran

*Fivetran is a fully-managed SaaS; faucet-stream is a binary you own. Here's the honest trade-off.*

> Reflects each tool as of **2026-07**. Fivetran's catalog and pricing change; check [fivetran.com](https://www.fivetran.com/) for current details.

## The short version

**Fivetran** is a fully-managed, closed-source ELT **SaaS**: you configure connectors in its UI, and Fivetran hosts and operates everything — scheduling, retries, schema handling, and connector maintenance. It has a large catalog (500+), strong log-based CDC, and usage-based pricing (monthly active rows).

**faucet-stream** is the opposite model: a **self-hosted, open-source binary (and library)** you run on your own infrastructure, with pipelines defined as version-controlled YAML and governance built into the movement path — no per-row bill, no vendor lock-in, data and credentials never leaving your systems.

Reach for faucet-stream when you want to **own the pipeline** — self-hosted, config-as-code, and free of usage-based cost.

## Where faucet-stream is different

- **Self-hosted and open source.** Data and credentials stay on your infrastructure; there's no third party in the path and no lock-in. You run one binary on compute you already have.
- **Config-as-code.** Pipelines are version-controlled YAML you diff, review, and run in CI — not UI state in someone else's account.
- **Predictable cost.** No monthly-active-rows pricing that scales with data volume; you pay only for the compute you'd run anyway.
- **Governance in the movement path.** Data-quality checks, versioned data contracts, PII masking (before any sink sees a row), schema-drift policy, column-level lineage (OpenLineage) + a catalog, and freshness/volume SLAs — native, not paywalled add-ons.
- **Embeddable.** Compile the same engine into your own Rust service via the typed `Source` / `Sink` traits.

## Where Fivetran is the better choice

Straight with you — a managed service earns its keep in real ways:

- **Zero maintenance.** Fivetran operates the connectors, absorbs upstream API changes and schema drift, and provides enterprise support and compliance. You don't run or babysit anything.
- **Catalog breadth.** 500+ professionally-maintained connectors across a long tail of SaaS sources.
- **You want a product, not a tool.** Where the operational burden of self-hosting outweighs the cost and control trade-offs, a managed SaaS is the right call.

## Side-by-side

| | **faucet-stream** | Fivetran |
|---|---|---|
| Model | self-hosted open-source binary + library | fully-managed proprietary SaaS |
| Pipeline definition | version-controlled YAML/JSON | UI (also API / Terraform) |
| Connectors | 58 built-in | 500+ managed |
| Change data capture | ✓ Postgres / MySQL / Mongo | ✓ log-based |
| Where data / credentials live | your infrastructure | Fivetran's infrastructure |
| Cost model | free (compute you already run) | usage-based (monthly active rows) |
| Governance in-path (quality / contracts / masking / lineage / SLA) | ✓ native | partial / paywalled |
| Embeddable as a library | ✓ (Rust) | ✗ |
| License | MIT / Apache-2.0 | Proprietary |

## Migrating from Fivetran

The mental model maps cleanly onto config-as-code:

| Fivetran | faucet-stream |
|---|---|
| a source connector (UI) | a `source` block |
| a destination | a `sink` block |
| connector settings / schedules | `faucet.yaml` + a `schedule:` block (or cron/CI) |
| incremental sync / CDC | resumable `state:` + CDC sources |
| dbt transformations | in-flight `transforms:` (or pair with dbt for in-warehouse modeling) |

Start from [your first pipeline](../getting-started/first-pipeline.md) and the [connector catalog](../reference/connectors.md).
